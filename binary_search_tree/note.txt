Q: Binary Tree?
Ans: In binary tree, a parent node has either 0 child or 2 child node that's why binary tree.

Q: BST
Ans: In binary search tree nodes are arranged in such like that a parent node either has 0 node or if it has any child node
then left side node have value will be less than parent node's value and right side node have value will be greater than parent node's value.
eg:      5
       /   \
      3     7
     / \     \
    1   4     8

Q: Perfect BST
Ans: A BST where parent node will have 0 node or 2 nodes
eg:      5
       /   \
      3     7
     / \   /  \
    1   4  6   8

Q: Time complexity?
Ans: insert - O(log n)
     lookup - O(log n)
     remove - O(log n)

nodes = 2^height - 1
nodes in example tree = 2^3 - 1 = 7

because log n < n as in case of BST we don't need to traverse through all elements as in array because of its property
of parent child relation that's why for operations like insert and delete BST is better that Array. Meanwhile
lookup is good in Array(O(1)) than BST(O(log n))


Q: Balanced and Unbalanced Tree
Ans: For worst case it could be possible that if suppose elements are like
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10
then Tree is unbalanced because of its parent child relationship law due to that time complexity can be increased to
O(n). There are some solutions to avoid unbalanced tree type of formation.
