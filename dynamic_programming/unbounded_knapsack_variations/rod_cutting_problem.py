# Problem statement:
# We have given a rod of a length, we need to cut this road upto it length pieces. Means for eg: if we have
# a rod of length 8, then we can cut this length upto 8 pieces. For each n pieces cost will be given.
# so we need to find out the max cost to cut this road into pieces


# This problem is just an unbounded knapsack problem just it is renamed as a new problem
