identification:

* choices will be given in question
* enhanced recursion
* in DP problem, there might be asked for optimal solution(means get min, get max)
* when a function call itself more than ones at a time then there might be possibility that curr sub problem
  already solved somewhere previously this is called function overlapping. Then in this case we can store
  previous sub-problem output in matrix or dictionary
