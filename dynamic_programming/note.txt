identification:

* choices will be given in question
* enhanced recursion
* in DP problem, there might be asked for optimal solution(means get min, get max)
* when a function call itself more than ones at a time then there might be possibility that curr sub problem
  already solved somewhere previously this is called function overlapping. Then in this case we can store
  previous sub-problem output in matrix or dictionary


parent question of DP
2. 0-1 knapsack (6 question based)
3. unbounded knapsack (5 question based)
4. fibonacci (7 question based)
5. LCS (15 question based)
6. LIS (10 question based)
7. kadane's algo (6 question based)
8. matrix chain multiplication (7 question based)
9. DP on trees (4 question based)
10. DP on grid (14 question based)
11. others (5 question based)

very common mistake. For memo to work, the result for [i..n) should not depend on [0, i)
