lookup - O(n)
* as in case of memory collision(generally will happen in memory constraint) we need to find out key's value in deeper in linked list
through loops
* although we can lookup on any flexible keys while in array lookup is faster than dictionary but we can do lookup only on
index

search - O(n)
insert - O(n)
delete - O(n)
