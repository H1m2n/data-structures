Array could be of 2 types
1. static array -  where we predefined length of array
2. dynamic array - length increases dynamically, how?
ans - dynamic array double up its default size when you going to insert element eveerytime when array got packed
that's why sometimes push or append operation will have time complexity O(n) -> why? when array got packed then
memory reallocation happens for previous allocated elements

time complexity

push -----> O(1) / O(n)
pop  -----> O(1)
delete ---> O(n)
lookup ---> O(1)
