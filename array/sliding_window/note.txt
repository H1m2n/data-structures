Sliding window questions are of 2 types
1> Fixed size window
2> Variable size window

1> Fixed size window
    In this approach we will have 2 pointers
    a> initially i = j = 0
    b> we increase j until we don't hit the window size that is provided in the question.
    c> window size k = j - i + 1.
        eg a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        if k = 3, window can be 0 to 2, 1 to 3, 2 to 4...
        so the conclusion is 2 - 0 + 1 means j - i + 1 will be equal to window size
    d> Once we hit the window size, we will create next window by increasing
       i++ and j++
