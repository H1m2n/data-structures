Stack can be formed with Array as well as linked list too.

It provides only operations like push, pop, peek




bottom         top
10<-----20<-----30

holding_pointer = self.top
self.top = Node
self.top.next = holding_pointer

IMPORTANT------>
Pattern to identify that a question will be solved from stack is:
* if we using 2 loops and inner loop is dependent on outer loop then it is the high possibility that
the question can be solved by stack in O(n).

for eg: for given array we need to find out nearest right greater element
arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
out = [3, 4, 4, -1]

Brute force approach: Time complexity is O(n^2)
nearest_greatest_ele = []

for i = 0; i < n-1; i++ {
  ele_found_f = 0
  for j = i+1; j < n; j++ {
      if arr[j] > arr[i]:
        nearest_greatest_ele.append(arr[j])
        ele_found_f = 1
        break
  }
  if ele_found_f == 0:
      nearest_greatest_ele.append(-1)
}

Note: Because in above sample code j is depend on i, so the question can be solved by stack in O(n)
