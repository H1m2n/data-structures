Time complexity
append - O(1)
prepend - O(1)
insert - O(n) but better than array because in array we need to shift elements from inserting index position to right
          while in linked list we need to traverse at inserting position and now just played with the references
delete - O(n)
lookup - O(n)
search - O(n)
