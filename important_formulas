1. Sum of N natural number = N(N+1) / 2
   Use case -> We have an array that should has numbers 1 to N, but one number is missing,
               found missing number

2. Number of possible pairs for N number = N * (N - 1) / 2
   Explanation ->
   Imagine a room with n people, each of whom shakes hands with everyone else.
   If you focus on just one person you see that she participates in n−1 handshakes. Since there are n people,
   that would lead to n(n−1) handshakes

   To finish the problem, we should realize that the total of n(n−1) counts every handshake twice,
   once for each of the two people involved. So the number of handshakes is n(n−1)/2.
